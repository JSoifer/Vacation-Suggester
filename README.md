#### _A survey which returns a vacation destination, June 10, 2018_

#### By _**Julianne Soifer**_

## Description

_This is a vacation suggester which gathers input from a user and returns a destination suggestion based on the information collected. It is a project for my coding class to demonstrate javascript branching comprehension._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone this repository_
* _Open the html file in your browser_
* _or go to https://jsoifer.github.io/Vacation-Suggester/_


_I think you should be able to interact with my project using the steps above.  If you want to view the files in an editor, you probably know how to do that. I would clone the project folder to my desktop and them type in $atom . I feel likeI should be giving more information here, but I'm not sure what._

## Known Bugs

_I would like to add a second result which relates to the destination but gives the user additional information based on an additional preference. I ran low on time though, so I'm submitting it without and might add it later._
